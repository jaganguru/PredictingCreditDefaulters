# PredictingCreditDefaulters
#Goal

 1. To build a model that predicts whether a customer is going to default a  payment or not. 
 2. From the perspective of risk control, estimating the probability of default will be more meaningful than classifying customers into       the binary results â€“ risky and non- risky
 3. To Identify the variables that influence payment defaults.
 
 #Models Applied
 
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes Classifier
3. Rpart Decision Tree
4. Random Forest

#Results: Randomforest has the best accuracy and ROC.
